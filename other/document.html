	This project aims to design a carpool application based on Android platform, providing convenient services for both drivers and passengers willing to carpool. For those experienced with carpool, they may find it difficult to find carpool information. Even though they find, negotiation between drivers and passengers on picking up time and location becomes a serious problem. Therefore, a well-developed application for carpool is necessary and significant. Most people use Android mobile devices, and they are used to getting information from their mobile devices, thus an application on Android platform is, of course, a right choice.

	<br><br>3. Functional Properties<br>
Functional properties of this app are categorized into four modules depending on their logical purpose, which are user module, carpool module, chat module and review module.<br>

<br><br>3.1 User Module<br>
The user module contains basic user behavior functions for this app to run properly, such as sign up and sign in.

<br><br>3.1.1 Sign Up<br>
First-time users of this app need to sign up for an account in order to access other functions. Users need to provide their basic information, including username, password and email. Users also have to choose their identities, driver, passenger or both. If users include driver in their identity, a detailed information of their vehicles will be required. Otherwise, users are signed up as a passenger and will be signed in automatically.
 
<br><br>3.1.2 Sign In<br>
Signed up users need to input their username and password to sign in to the app. The app will remember the input information so that users only need to sign in once. This app will have two sets of UI designed for passengers and drivers to access different functions. When signing in, the app will show the appropriate UI depending on the user’s identity. For users signed up as both identities, the app will display the UI for drivers as default and will allow users to switch their identity in the app.

<br><br>3.1.3 Manage Profile<br>
Users can add personal information to their profile and edit added information, such as gender, age and other contact info. Users who signed up as a driver can also manage their vehicle information. If users didn’t sign up as a driver, they could add driver to their identity by providing vehicle information. Users can also reset and retrieve their password. Reset password requires users to input the correct old password first. Retrieve password requires users to input the correct username and email address they used to sign up, and then an email with login information will be sent to their mailbox.

<br><br>3.2 Carpool Module<br>
Carpool module contains all the functions related to carpool, which are the core functions of this app. Some functions are exclusively accessible for certain users, for example, create carpool is only available to drivers and demand carpool is only available to passengers. Other functions will behave differently depending on the user’s identity.

<br><br>3.2.1 Create Carpool<br>
Drivers who have provided their vehicle information can create carpools. To create a carpool, users need to provide the departing/arriving location through Google Map API. Other required information includes departure date/time, maximum passenger numbers and a general price. Departure date/time can be set as a range. Users who create a carpool automatically become the driver of that particular carpool.

<br><br>3.2.2 Demand Carpool<br>
Passengers can post a carpool demand by providing the desired departing/arriving location (through Google Map API) and departing date/time, as well as an ideal price. Departure date/time can also be set as a range.

<br><br>3.2.3 Search Carpool<br>
Passengers can search existing carpools by providing their ideal departing/arriving location (also through Google Map API) and departing date/time. The app will first search for valid carpools regarding departing date/time and passenger numbers. Then, the app will compute how long the passenger needs to walk for each valid carpool by comparing the departing/arriving location with the passenger’s ideal location. Finally, a list of top matched carpools with relatively shortest walking distance will be picked as the final search result. Similarly, drivers can search among demanded carpools.

<br><br>3.2.4 Select Carpool<br>
Carpools in the final search result will be presented to passengers once at a time. For each carpool, passengers can check its detail information, including price and driver’s reviews (see 3.4). Passengers can decline an uninterested carpool, add a carpool to their interested list (see 3.2.5) or confirm the carpool if they decide it is a perfect match. Correspondingly, drivers can decline an uninterested demand, add a demanded carpool to their interested list or confirm the demanded carpool.
If a passenger confirms a carpool, the driver of that carpool will receive a notification, available seats would go down by one. If a driver confirmed a demanded carpool, the passenger who demanded that carpool will receive a notification and this carpool is added to existing carpool list so it can be searched by other passengers.

<br><br>3.2.5 Manage Carpool List<br>
Passengers can manage three types of carpool list. Demanded list allows passengers to edit or delete their demand carpool post and receive notifications. The interested list allows them to check, compare and delete their interested carpools so that they can decide which one to join. Confirmed list allows passengers to check their confirmed carpools’ schedule, chat online (see 3.3) and complete the carpool trip (see 3.2.6). Drivers can also manage three types of carpool list with similar functions, which are created list, interested list and confirmed list. 

<br><br>3.2.6 Carpool Trip<br>
To start a carpool trip, confirmed passengers need to make another confirmation indicating that they have got in the car. Once all the passengers made this confirmation, the carpool trip begins and a navigation to the destination will be provided to the driver through Google Map API. Upon reaching the destination, the driver can make a confirmation to each passenger indicating that he/she has paid for this trip. After receiving the driver’s approval, passengers can write reviews about the driver (see 3.4), thus the carpool trip is completed.

<br><br>3.3 Chat Module<br>
When passengers confirm to join a carpool, they automatically join a group chat with the driver and all the other confirmed passenger of that carpool. This chat function allows drivers and passengers to conveniently discuss the detail of the trip online, thus increase the flexibility of this app. For example, if the driver is possible to pick up passengers along the way then the passengers don’t have to walk to the departing location, or they can re-negotiate for a more reasonable price.

<br><br>3.4 Review Module<br>
After receiving the driver’s confirmation that they have paid for the carpool trip, passengers can rate the driver and write reviews. The rate and reviews of a driver will serve as a significant factor for other passengers to decide whether to join a carpool or not, which will lead to a better service among drivers.
